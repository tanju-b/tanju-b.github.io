title: Introducing my blog
---

Hi World! This is my new blog being built with intent of tracking my various projects, ideas, muses, and learnings in a more centralized location leveraging git/GitHub.   The central theme being my adventures in *making*, as in *"Make"*, as in *"Maker culture"*, etc, etc.

Initial projects already in process:


*  The Maker Station makerspace in Marietta.
*  e-Nable 3D printed prosthetic hands.
*  PowerRacingSeries modified powerwheels.
*  Learning basic datascience.

Thanks for checking it out!
