Hi World! This is my new blog being built with intent of tracking my varied project, ideas, muses, and learnings in a more centralized location leveraging git/GitHub.   The central theme being my adventures in *making*, as in *"Make"*, as in *"Maker culture"8, etc, etc.

Thanks for checking it out!
