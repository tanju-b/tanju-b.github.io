### Making Stuff
**Procuring** hardware for the e-Nable hands is turning out to require way more effort than the actual printing.  Yesterday I spent more than a half hour at Michael's craft store assessing all the options for elastic and tension cords for the finger actuation that I completely forgot to get the needed velcro.
**Similarly,** I tried 3 different local medical pharmacies for the medical grade foam and came up empty handed.
**And then** after going to Lowes hardware store twice and accidentally buying 3/8" long binding post screws instead of 1/4" long, I got tired of going and decided to trim to length.
The screws are too small to hold to take off 1/8" so I designed and printed this little jig sized for the post diameter. With care it can also be used to trim the screws. 
Aluminum screws cut fast, in less than a minute.
**This** was my major accomplishment for the day.
