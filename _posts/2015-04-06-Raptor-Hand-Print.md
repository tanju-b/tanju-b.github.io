### April 6, 2015

We had good success printing out the raptor hand. We are liking this design better than the cyborg-beast because the connecting pins are part of the design and are printed along with the rest of the other parts. It makes assembly more productive and satisfying to see it all come together so fast, vs having to size holes and bolting for cyborg beast. In the pic , te cyborg beast is sitting on the table waiting on hardware.
