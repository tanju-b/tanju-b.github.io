**Besides** 3D printing hands, we have several other projects going on down at the io-estate and the Maker Station.  I'm pretty excited to start making some progress on our entry into this season's Power Racing Series race at the Atlanta MakerFaire.

**While** the gauntlet and palm parts were printing last weekend, I mocked up the car's frame in PVC.  A couple of days ago I procured some 1/2" steel tubing from Metals Supermarket... which was not as *super* as I had hoped.  However, it was *super convenient* in that I placed the order online, and was able to pick it up later that day.  I was hoping to find a big warehouse type of supermarket where I could wander through and see steel and cutting machines because *steel*, but instead it was just a small store front and the guy went back into the employees only warehouse to grab my order.  The entire transaction took all of two minutes, *super convenient*.   

**Also** the guy behind the counter sound German or Eastern European.  He frowned when he saw me because it was 5:05pm when I arrived and he promptly informed me that they were closed.  "But", I replied, "it's just a tiny order, already paid for... just 4 pieces of 0.5" x 6' square tube".  He frowned, but went back and got it.
The transaction made me chuckle.  A couple days ago I read [this fanboy answer on Quora about mechanical engineering school in Germany](http://qr.ae/d9LWc), and here I was at Metal Supermarket of Marietta getting the evil eye from a German metal salesman.

**I'm hoping** to get down to the Station this weekend to cut and melt some steel into the intended frame.
Against everyone at the Station's better judgement, I elected to go with 1/2" square tube because, weight.  If it doesn't hold up, we'll just fix it and reinforce it.
