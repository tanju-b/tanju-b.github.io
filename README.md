Repository for my maker blog

This blog was built off of Hyde-Poole, with set up guidance from Josh Lande: http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole/ .
I also referenced a bit of this tutorial during the initial set up: http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/getting-to-know-github-pages-static-project-pages-fast--webdesign-11501

Thank you interwebz for sharing the knowledge

# Hyde

Hyde is a brazen two-column [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) theme that pairs a prominent sidebar with uncomplicated content. It's based on [Poole](http://getpoole.com), the Jekyll butler.
